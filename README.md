# Note-taker-express-js

## Your Task

Your assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a note taking web application so I can list notes and save them. A future iteration of the project would be to add a delete function. 
- I built this project so I had a stored place online to save all my tasks.
- This tool will help me keep track of my day to day tasks wherever I am without the need to carry a notebook.
- Whilst working on this project I learned about api and html routes as well as deploying a website to Heroku.
